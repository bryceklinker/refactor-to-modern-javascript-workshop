# What will You Learn?

During this workshop you will learn the basics of modern Javascript. 
If you are unfamiliar with or hate JavaScript this workshop is for you. We will be 
covering JavaScript classes, arrow functions, let vs. const vs. var, currying, npm, node, 
and webpack.

# What we will build?

We will be refactoring an existing application to use new JavaScript concepts and tooling. 
The existing application relies heavily on jQuery and Dust.js. The application also does 
not use any kind of bundler for preparing the application for the web. We will migrate 
this application little by little to use new JavaScript standards and libraries.

## What is the application?

The requirements for the application in question can be found [here](./docs/vending-machine.md).
However, the need to know the requirements isn't necessary as we have tests in place that verify
most of the application logic.
